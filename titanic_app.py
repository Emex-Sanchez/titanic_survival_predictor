Welcome to the Titanic Survival Predictor!  
This app uses a **Machine Learning model (Logistic Regression)** trained on the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster.

 üí° How it works:
- You provide passenger details (class, sex, age, fare, etc.)
- The model calculates the probability of survival
- Based on the prediction, the app tells you if the person **survived (1)** or **did not survive (0)**

> This project was built using `Python`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `Streamlit`.
